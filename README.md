# USE AT YOUR OWN RISK I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY ACCOUNTS BEING BANNED
I botted myself from 75-99 mage without being detected/banned
- The reason why this "bot" / "autoclicker" is undetectable is because of it's randomization, basically it chooses a random time interval to click in between, and randomly changes the interval, while randomly choosing an amount of time to hold / release the mouse. (essentially triple random)
Stay safe and have fun botting :) 
btw the GUI is shit so if anyone wants to make a better one, feel free to.
# USAGE: 
- Setup your inventory for normal alch use
- Launch the application
- Click the "start" button to begin the autoclicker
- Hover your mouse over the "High level Alchemy" spell 
- Go afk
- ?? MAD GAINZ ??
- Click the stop button to stop.
